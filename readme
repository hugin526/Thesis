1. 🇯🇵 cybersecurity collection.py

Japanese National Diet – Cyber-only corpus
Data source
National Diet Library API: https://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/

What the script does:
Queries Diet debates using the any (全文検索) parameter
Filters speeches containing cyber-related terms (e.g.:cyber, サイバー, サイバーセキュリティ, cybersecurity)

Automatically paginates using nextRecordPosition
Deduplicates speeches using speechID
Outputs a single, cleaned cyber-only corpus

Output
FINAL.CYBER.speeches.tsv
One row per speech
UTF-8 encoded, tab-separated
Suitable for Voyant Tools, Excel, KH Coder, or Python analysis
Key methodological note
This script does not download full Diet debates.
Only speeches explicitly framed using cyber language are included.

2. 🇬🇧 UK cyber filter.py

UK Parliament (Hansard) – Cyber-only corpus
Data source
UK Hansard XML (ParlParse format)

Typically includes:
House of Lords debates
(Configurable for Commons / Westminster Hall if needed)

What the script does
Parses local Hansard XML files
Filters speeches containing: cyber, cybersecurity, cyber security


Filters by date range (default: 2015–2025)
Deduplicates by speech ID
Separates speech text from metadata
 
Outputs
speeches.tsv
DocID, text
metadata.tsv
id, date, house, member, party, debate_type, heading, file
Both outputs are UTF-8, tab-separated.

Comparative Design Rationale
Both scripts apply keyword-based filtering at the data-collection stage, rather than collecting full parliamentary debates and filtering later.
Advantages
Ensures cross-national comparability
Focuses analysis on explicit cybersecurity framing
Reduces noise from unrelated financial or political discourse
Makes large-scale text analysis computationally feasible
Known limitations
Financial cybersecurity discourse is captured only when explicitly framed as “cyber”
Implicit or adjacent discussions (e.g. fraud, payments, operational risk without cyber language) may be excluded
These limitations are acknowledged and addressed in the methodology and discussion chapters of the thesis.

Intended Use
The resulting datasets are designed for:
Word frequency analysis
Collocation and co-occurrence analysis
Trend analysis over time
Thematic categorisation (e.g. risk governance, systemic risk, regulation)
Comparative discourse analysis between Japan and the UK

Reproducibility Notes
Both scripts:
Use UTF-8 encoding
Are deterministic given the same inputs and date ranges
Can be rerun to update datasets for future years

Date ranges and keyword lists can be modified directly in each script
